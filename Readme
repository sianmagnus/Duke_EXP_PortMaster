Slightly edited Duke 3D Portmaster files to work with the official expantion
from https://github.com/romadu/NBlood

Each of the expansion require atomic edition Duke 3D files names are case sensative
all require DUKE3D.GRP and DUKE.RTS
then the appropriate grp for each expansion
DUKEDC.GRP
VACATION.GRP
NWINTER.GRP

Placed in the gamedata folder

roms\ports\rednukem-dn3d-dc\gamedata\
  DUKE3D.GRP
  DUKE.RTS
  DUKEDC.GRP

roms\ports\rednukem-dn3d-vacation\gamedata\
  DUKE3D.GRP
  DUKE.RTS
  VACATION.GRP

roms\ports\rednukem-dn3d-winter\gamedata\
