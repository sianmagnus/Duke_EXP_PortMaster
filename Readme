Slightly edited Duke 3D Portmaster files to work with the official expantion
from https://github.com/romadu/NBlood

Each of the expansion require atomic edition Duke 3D files names are case sensative
all require DUKE3D.GRP and DUKE.RTS
then the appropriate grp for each expansion
NWINTER.GRP
VACATION.GRP
DUKEDC.GRP

Thanks to Nukeykt for the Rednukem engine that makes this possible. Also thanks to romadu for the porting work for portmaster.
